# ZetAspects

Drop Rate from Killed Elites changed to 1 in 500.

Configurable drop chance multiplier for each elite type.

Drop chance is halved every time one drops in a run (0.2% -> 0.1%).

Changes the Elite Aspects into scalable Drop Only Boss Tier Items.

Aspects can be configured to be Red Tier or kept as Equipment.

Clicking the Equipment icon at the bottom-right of the screen will Convert it into an Item.

## Item Changes:

Wake of Vultures lasts for 20 (+10 per stack) seconds and also gives a buff to stats on killing elites.

Transcendence grants 50% of life regeneration as shield regeneration.

Fixed VoidBearCooldown buff and made it stack.
